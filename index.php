			<p> Hello! My name is Victoria Chacon. <br> I am a current student of CNM's Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. Some previous scholl history includes a Bachelor's degree from the University of New Mexico in Profession Writing. I have used my writing skills to intern for a local magazine ABQ-live. I also went through CNM's Digital Media track and gained experience in graphic design. I used these skills both at ABQ-live and a non-profit organization known as Alta Mira Specialized Family Services.</p>
